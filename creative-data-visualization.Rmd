# These are some {knitr} options I typically use to format my ***RMarkdown*** documents in a consistent way
# You should feel free to alter these or use other "chunk options" as you see fit!
# Sometimes, for example, you might want to suppress warnings or
# messages, and that behavior can be set for specific code chunks in
# the chunk header, e.g., ```{r warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  eval = TRUE, # run code in code chunks
  echo = TRUE, # render output of code chunks
  warning = TRUE, # do not suppress "warnings"
  message = TRUE, # do not suppress "messages"
#  comment = "##", # prefix for comment lines
#  prompt = ">", # prefix for code lines

  tidy.opts = list(blank = FALSE, width.cutoff = 75),
  fig.path = "images/", # name of folder for images
  fig.align = "center" # centers any images on the page
