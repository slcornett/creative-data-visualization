## Background on data\
When I was in the second semester of my third year of undergrad, I took a course called "Enzymes," which was essentially a literature based biochemistry class on specific classes of enzymes. It was very organic chemistry focused--makes sense since biochem is bio-applied orgo-- and it inspired me to ask this research question in the Research Neurophysiology class I was taking that semester: how do reduction and oxidation (*redox*) reagents modulate the chloride current through chloride-selective ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC)?\
The chloride LGIC in question here is the Glycine receptor. Glycine receptors mediate inhibitory synaptic transmission through the opening of a chloride-permeable pore that triggers hyperpolarization of the membrane and inhibition of the neuronal firing generated in the central nervous system (CNS). Glycine receptors are pentameric structures comprised of five subunits ($\alpha$ and $\beta$), each composed of four transmembrane domains (**Figure 1**; Lynch et al., 2004; Du et al., 2015). A central concept of the relationship between ligand binding and channel gating in Cys-loop receptors is the conformation of the Cys-loop correlate swith the functional state of the receptor (**Figure 1**; Du et al., 2015; Purohit & Auerbach, 2013; Thompson, 2010). The allosteric change in the ligand-binding domain affects the $\alpha$-subunits, resulting in the rotations of their inner $\beta$-sheets. The rotations of the sheets are transmitted by their connected M2-helices to the pore’s gate resulting in a configuration permeable to the ion. The $\alpha$-subunits act as the primary mediators of the conformational change by connecting to the transmembrane portion of the receptor, characterized by a counter-clockwise rotation of the pore’s axis (Du et al., 2015; Unwin et al., 2002).\
Reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) are endogenous redox agents naturally present in the CNS at millimolar concentrations (5-10mM) (Calero & Calvaro, 2008). Pan et al. (1995) found, in retinal ganglion cells GSH at 5mM enhanced GABA-activated chloride currents and decreased glycine-activated chloride currents through their respective receptors. Amato et al. (1999) confirmed Pan et al.’s finding in HEK cells, showing at concentrations ranging from 1-10mM, GSH enhanced GABA-activated response in concentration-dependent manner while GSSG caused small inhibitory effects.\

### **GSSG** Trace Plots for Art\
Here I plot the trace for the Glycine receptor exposed to GSSG with its absolute value trace. I think they look cool. 
```{r GSSG + abGSSG, out.width="100%"}
# adding the absolute value to plot bot the current and absolute value of the current together 
# because i bet it would look very cool
gssg <- gssg %>% mutate("abGSSG_Current_µA" = abs(GSSG_Current_µA)) 
 #gather(key = "Current", value = "value", abGSSG_Current_µA ) # collapses 2 variables into key-value pairs
head(gssg) # cool absolute value present in the dataset

# try to plot two traces on the same plot
# static
gssg_p2 <- ggplot(data = gssg, aes(x = time_s)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = GSSG_Current_µA, color = GSSG_Current_µA), show.legend = FALSE) +
